Sending e-Mail via SMTP

## Install

To install park_mail you must first have both Node.js and NPM installed, both of which are outside the scope of this tool. See the [Node.js Website](http://nodejs.org) for details on how to install Node.js. Personaly I am found of Tim Caswell's excelent [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) tool for insalling and managing node.

Once NPM is installed, simply install Park Mailer by executing the following from the command line:

  /*npm install park_mail -g*/ not release yet
